## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd fireblocks-weather-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   If you want you can use your own API key, but I included mine in `.env`, so you're good to go
   ```env
   VITE_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```
   
   Get your free API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
   The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or next available port)

5. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Preview production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

## 🛠️ Technology Choices

### **Why Vite?**
- ⚡ **Lightning Fast** - Instant hot module replacement (HMR)
- 🔧 **Zero Config** - Works out of the box with TypeScript and React
- 📦 **Optimized Builds** - Rollup-based bundling for production
- 🔄 **Modern Tooling** - Native ES modules support
- 🚀 **Better DX** - Faster builds compared to Create React App

### **Why Material-UI (MUI)?**
- 🎨 **Design System** - Consistent, professional components
- ♿ **Accessibility** - Built-in ARIA support and keyboard navigation
- 📱 **Responsive** - Mobile-first responsive design utilities
- 🎯 **Theming** - Powerful customization and styling system
- 🔧 **Developer Experience** - Excellent TypeScript support

### **Why TypeScript?**
- 🛡️ **Type Safety** - Catch errors at compile time
- 🔍 **Better IntelliSense** - Enhanced IDE support and autocomplete
- 📚 **Self-Documenting** - Types serve as inline documentation
- 🚀 **Refactoring** - Safe and confident code changes

### 🎯 **Modular Architecture Benefits**
- **Maintainability** - Each component has a single responsibility
- **Reusability** - Components can be easily reused across the app
- **Testability** - Isolated components are easier to unit test
- **Scalability** - Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
- **Developer Experience** - Clear file organization improves navigation
- **Code Splitting** - Better bundle optimization and loading performance

## 📱 Mobile Compatibility

The app is fully responsive and optimized for:
- 📱 **Mobile Phones** - Touch-friendly interface with proper spacing
- 📟 **Tablets** - Adaptive layout for medium screens
- 💻 **Desktop** - Full-featured experience on large screens
- 🔄 **Orientation Changes** - Seamless portrait/landscape transitions

## 🎮 Usage

1. **Search for Weather** - Enter any city name in the search bar
2. **View Weather Data** - Get current conditions and detailed metrics
3. **Get Activity Suggestions** - Receive personalized recommendations
4. **Play Trivia** - Test your weather knowledge on the home page
5. **Learn Something New** - Read detailed explanations for trivia answers

## 🏆 Bonus Backend Component Note

**Regarding the bonus backend component**: I understand there was a bonus opportunity for implementing a backend component, but I wasn't entirely sure about its specific purpose or requirements. 

If I were to implement it, I would focus on:
- **API Caching Layer** - Cache weather API calls for ~15 minutes to prevent rate limiting (429 errors)
- **Request Optimization** - Batch requests and implement intelligent retry logic
- **Data Persistence** - Store frequently requested cities for faster responses
- **Analytics** - Track popular searches and trivia performance

The current implementation efficiently handles the frontend requirements while maintaining excellent performance and user experience.

## 🚀 Performance & Optimization

- **Bundle Size** - Optimized to ~500kB with code splitting
- **API Efficiency** - Smart error handling and request management
- **Animation Performance** - Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms
- **Memory Management** - Proper cleanup and state management
- **Loading States** - Smooth transitions and user feedback

## 🔧 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint checks
